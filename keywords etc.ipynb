    "     The for loop is by far the most popular loop in Python. It's built by blending two Python keywords.\n",

    " 2.  The while Keyword\n",
    "     Python's while loop employs the term while and functions similarly to other computer languages' while loops.\n",
    "     The block after the while phrase will be repeated repeatedly until the condition following the while keyword is false.\n",
    " \n",
    " 3.  The break Keyword\n",
    "     If you want to quickly break out of a loop, employ the break keyword. We can use this keyword in both \n",
    "     for and while loops.\n",
    "     \n",
    " 4.  The continue Keyword\n",
    "     You can use the continue Python keyword if you wish to jump to the subsequent loop iteration. The continue \n",
